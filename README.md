# Classes

### Tables
As well as the normal tables the theme offers some variations with classes:
+ table-bordered
+ table-striped
+ table-condensed

### Full page images
Full page images are achieved with the following markdown `#full`

```markdown
[img](some/image/file.jpg#full)
```

### Other Images

There are two other image classes:

+ img-framed
+ img-circle

# Floating Header

The floating header is set to use a logo image or site title but not both. You can use both but results will be crowded header

# Prism
Prism is an alternative code to Google code. The theme has a copy of the js and css files in the theme. Call using

    <pre><code class="langauge-css">
    header {
        font-size: 2.3rem;
        color: #333333;
        margin-top: .4rem;
    }
    </code></pre>


Change the css for the required code type.


# Notes
Look into class `no-image` in the headers - no-image removes the featured image and the figure tags
